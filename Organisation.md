This is what each team member in this group has contributed to this project:

-Jessie
*I implemented the Concert and Performer domain classes and also helped annotate the DTOs to ensure proper serialisation and de-serialisation. 
 I implemented the Config class for the authentication cookie and the Concert and Performer mappers. Other than that, I also implemented some APIs in the ConcertResource. 
-Jasveer
*I implemented User domain class and helped in implementing some APIs in the ConcertResource. Some of the APIs I implemented were overridden by Jessie 
 when he pushed his implementations of the APIs to the repo. However, I also helped him out in the implementation of the APIs he did.
