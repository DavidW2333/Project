This is what each team member in this group has contributed to this project:

-Jessie

-Jasveer

-David
* Domain - I have constructed BOOKING and SEATS class 
* Mapper - I have completed the BookingMapper and SeatMapper as creating SeatMapper is required before the completion of the BookingMapper
* Service - I have done the login api, and all the concert related api such as retrieve all concerts, retrieve concerts summary



When we first started this project, we have discussed and came into an agreement that all of us will do some parts of each section(Domain,
mapper, and service), which is why there are commits from all of our teammates for domain model. We have constructed our domain model based on the 
concert-common/dto class, ConcertResourceIT class(the testing case so that we know what variable we need to add) and the database(for the annotation)

As for the concurrency issue.....
